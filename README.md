# NotionToDo
## Overview 
There is currently no Notion feature which allows users to compile & export all of their assigned to-do items from a workspace. In company/organizational Notion workspaces, a single employee's assigned to-do items are often nested and dispersed throughout the workspace, making them difficult to find and track. 

This project will instrument the Notion API to develop a "roll-up & export" feature for a user's assigned to-do items.

Note: This code was written prior to the introduction of *synced blocks* in the Notion API and needs to be updated.
